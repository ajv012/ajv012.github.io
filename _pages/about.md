I am a PhD student in Medical Engineering and Medical Physics at the [Harvard-MIT Program]("https://hst.mit.edu/"), concentrating in Computer Science. I aim to create machine learning technologies that help medical professionals provide the best possible care to patients, especially in low-resource settings.  

Prior to starting my Ph.D., I obtained my B.S. in Biomedical Engineering (minor in Computer Science) from Bucknell University. I was fortunate to work with [Ben Wheatley]("http://wheatley.scholar.bucknell.edu/") on computational biomechanics, with [Joshua Stough]("http://eg.bucknell.edu/~jvs008/") on  machine learning-based healthcare, and with [Aalpen Patel]("https://www.linkedin.com/in/aalpenpatel/") on liver tumor ablation probes. Outside of research, I also worked at Livongo Health (now Teladoc Health) as a backend software developer and helped create micro-services monitoring API. At Livongo, I had the chance to work [Norman Chen]("https://www.linkedin.com/in/norm/"), [Kunal Sachdeva]("https://www.linkedin.com/in/kunalsachdeva7/"), and [Suresh Margabandu]("https://www.linkedin.com/in/sureshm/").
